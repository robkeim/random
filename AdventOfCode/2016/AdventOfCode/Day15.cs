    // --- Day 15: Timing is Everything ---
    //
    // The halls open into an interior plaza containing a large kinetic sculpture.The sculpture is in a sealed enclosure and seems to involve a set of identical
    // spherical capsules that are carried to the top and allowed to bounce through the maze of spinning pieces.
    //
    // Part of the sculpture is even interactive! When a button is pressed, a capsule is dropped and tries to fall through slots in a set of rotating discs to finally
    // go through a little hole at the bottom and come out of the sculpture.If any of the slots aren't aligned with the capsule as it passes, the capsule bounces off
    // the disc and soars away. You feel compelled to get one of those capsules.
    //
    // The discs pause their motion each second and come in different sizes; they seem to each have a fixed number of positions at which they stop.You decide to call
    // the position with the slot 0, and count up for each position it reaches next.
    //
    // Furthermore, the discs are spaced out so that after you push the button, one second elapses before the first disc is reached, and one second elapses as the
    // capsule passes from one disk to the one below it.So, if you push the button at time = 100, then the capsule reaches the top disc at time = 101, the second disc
    // at time = 102, the third disc at time = 103, and so on.
    //
    // The button will only drop a capsule at an integer time - no fractional seconds allowed.
    //
    // For example, at time = 0, suppose you see the following arrangement:
    // Disc #1 has 5 positions; at time=0, it is at position 4.
    // Disc #2 has 2 positions; at time=0, it is at position 1.
    // If you press the button exactly at time = 0, the capsule would start to fall; it would reach the first disc at time = 1.Since the first disc was at position 4
    // at time = 0, by time=1 it has ticked one position forward.As a five-position disc, the next position is 0, and the capsule falls through the slot.
    //
    // Then, at time = 2, the capsule reaches the second disc. The second disc has ticked forward two positions at this point: it started at position 1, then continued
    // to position 0, and finally ended up at position 1 again.Because there's only a slot at position 0, the capsule bounces away.
    //
    // If, however, you wait until time = 5 to push the button, then when the capsule reaches each disc, the first disc will have ticked forward 5+1 = 6 times (to
    // position 0), and the second disc will have ticked forward 5+2 = 7 times(also to position 0). In this case, the capsule would fall through the discs and come
    // out of the machine.
    //
    // However, your situation has more than two discs; you've noted their positions in your puzzle input. What is the first time you can press the button to get a
    // capsule?
    // Disc #1 has 5 positions; at time=0, it is at position 2.\nDisc #2 has 13 positions; at time=0, it is at position 7.\nDisc #3 has 17 positions; at time=0, it is at position 10.\nDisc #4 has 3 positions; at time=0, it is at position 2.\nDisc #5 has 19 positions; at time=0, it is at position 9.\nDisc #6 has 7 positions; at time=0, it is at position 0.

    //
    // --- Part Two ---
    //
    // After getting the first capsule(it contained a star! what great fortune!), the machine detects your success and begins to rearrange itself.
    //
    // When it's done, the discs are back in their original configuration as if it were time=0 again, but a new disc with 11 positions and starting at position 0 has
    // appeared exactly one second below the previously-bottom disc.
    //
    //With this new disc, and counting again starting from time = 0 with the configuration in your puzzle input, what is the first time you can press the button to
    // get another capsule?
