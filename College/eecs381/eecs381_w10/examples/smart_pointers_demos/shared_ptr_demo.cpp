There is only a "half cycle" because Thing 1 is pointing to Thing 2, but Thing 2 points
to nobody. Discarding our pointer to Thing 2 does not destroy Thing 2 because it is kept alive
by Thing 1 pointing to it. When p1 goes out of scope Thing 1 is destroyed, which then results
in Thing 2 being destroyed. This shows smart pointers doing their automatical destruction.

Thing 1 is pointing to Thing 2
Thing 2 is pointing to nobody

Thing 2 destruction

and reset statements either in or commented out (doesn't change the output).
Notice how neither object gets destroyed! They keep each other alive!
