/* Notes:
1. The messages are classified by which module's .c file prints them out.
You must follow this classification to be sure your modules behave like mine.
Note that p1_main does all printing except for data about individual records 
and collections, which is output by their print functions.

2. Where two percent signs appear in a row ('%%'), change it to 
the appropriate printf formatting item. 

3. If there is no actual non-whitespace constant text involved in an output statement, 
the string is not shown here. 

4. Note how the command error messages listed below are output by p1_main; thus, 
functions in other modules must return an error condition to p1_main, 
which then prints the appropriate message from this list.
