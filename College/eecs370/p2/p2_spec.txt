1. Purpose

This project is intended to help you understand how procedure calls work
in assembly language and to give you experience designing and optimizing a
finite-state machine for a simple computer. 

2. Problem

This project has two parts.  In the first part, you will write an
assembly-language program to recursively compute combination(n,r)
(i.e. n choose r).  In the second part, you will sdimulate the computer at a
lower, more-detailed level.  Essentially, you will describe a finite-state
machine for the LC-2K7 in C.

3. Assembly-Language Program to Compute Combination(n,r) (30%)

Write an assembly-language program to recursively compute combination(n,r),
defined as:
    
    combination(n,0) = 1
    combination(n,n) = 1
    combination(n,r) = combination(n-1,r) + combination(n-1,r-1);

    0 <= r <= n

Here's a C function to do this; your assembly-language program will follow
this logic closely.

    int combination(int n, int r)
    {
	if (r==0 || n==r) {
	    return(1);
	} else {
	    return(combination(n-1,r) + combination(n-1,r-1));
	}
    }

Note that the definition of combination(n,r) is recursive.  Your
assembly-language program must also use a recursive function call.  That is,
your program should have a function that calls itself twice (to compute
combination(n-1,r) and combination(n-1,r-1)) and adds the results together.
This isn't the most efficient solution (e.g. n>9 will take a LONG time), but
using recursion will help you understand assembly-language procedure calls and
stacks.  Your program should input the value n and r from memory locations
labeled "n" and "r".  The result should be stored in register 3 when the
program halts.  Straightforward solutions are possible in about 45 lines.  If
your program is significantly longer than that, you are probably doing
something wrong.  Your program must be reasonably efficient, i.e. it must
execute at most 5000 instructions for n=7, r=3 (this is several times slower
than a good solution).

Passing parameters to subroutines can be confusing in assembly language.
It's easiest if you make most registers callee-save so the caller can assume
the subroutine leaves those registers unchanged.  These callee-saved registers
are typically pushed on the stack at the beginning of the subroutine and popped
off the stack just before the subroutine returns.

Not all registers can or should be callee-save, however.  For example, one
register will contain the subroutine's return value.  Also, the jalr instruction
used to return from the subroutine will leave a register with a different
value than it held when the subroutine was called.

Here is a small LC-2K7 program that uses a subroutine call.  It takes
an input and calls a subroutine to compute the quantity 4*input.
Register 1 is used to pass input to the subroutine; register 3 is used by
the subroutine to pass the result back.  The current top-of-stack (first
empty location) is given by stack + register 7.

	lw	0	5	pos1	$5 = 1
	lw	0	1	input	$1 = memory[input]
	lw	0	2	subAdr	prepare to call sub4n. $2=sub4n
	jalr	2	4		call sub4n; $4=return address; $3=answer
	halt
sub4n	sw	7	4	stack	save return address on stack
	add	7	5	7	increment stack pointer
	sw	7	1	stack	save $1 on stack
	add	7	5	7	increment stack pointer
	add	1	1	1	compute 2*input
	add	1	1	3	compute 4*input
	lw	0	2	neg1	$2 = -1
	add	7	2	7	decrement stack pointer
	lw	7	1	stack	recover original $1
	add	7	2	7	decrement stack pointer
	lw	7	4	stack	recover original return address
	jalr	4	2		return.  $2 is not restored.
pos1	.fill	1
neg1	.fill	-1
subAdr	.fill	sub4n			contains the address of sub4n
input	.fill	10			input = 10
stack	.fill	0			beginning of stack (value is irrelevant)

The stack array starts at label "stack" and extends to larger addresses,
so the label "stack" needs to be the last line in your program.

Make sure your assembly-language program works for the Project 1 solution
assembler and simulator, since that's how we'll test it.  Programs that don't
work with the solution assembler/simulator will receive a 0.

3.1. Tips

One difficult aspect of this program will be allocating variables
in the 8 LC-2K7 registers.  To make your job easier, here are the
register assignments I used--you may use these or choose your own.

    $0	value 0
    $1	n input to function
    $2	r input to function
    $3	return value of function
    $4	local variable for function
    $5	stack pointer
    $6	temporary value (can hold different values at different times, e.g.
	+1, -1, function address)
    $7	return address

To have printState print the contents of your stack, you can append a bunch
of ".fill 0" at the end of your assembly program after the "stack" label.

4. LC-2K7 Register Level

Project 1 described the behavior (architecture) of the LC-2K7.  In this
project, you will describe an implementation of the LC-2K7.  For this,
you will need the registers present in the LC-2K7.  The register-level
diagram of the LC-2K7 may be found on the class web site:

LC-2 register-level diagram (JPG GIF PDF)

The implementation style of the LC-2K7 is quite different than the textbook's
implementation of MIPS (even though the architectures of MIPS and LC-2K7 are
very similar).  LC-2K7 uses a system-bus to connect registers together, while
the textbook uses dedicated, point-to-point wires between components.

The lines and arrows in the project diagram show the paths that data can take
through the system.  This diagram does not show the control signals.  As an
example of how data uses the system bus to move between registers, memoryData
may drive the system bus and programCounter may latch the results.  Assume
that a register can drive the system bus and have another load that data, all
in one cycle.

The control unit (not shown) can read the current opcode bits of instrReg, the
memory ready signal (see Section 6), and the aluResult register (i.e. test if
aluResult is 0) to make decisions on what next state to go to. The control unit
can read these values without using the system bus. See the example under item
#1 in Section 5.

All registers (shaded boxes) can load and drive data (from and to where depends
on the connections and arrows in the diagram). In addition, the programCounter
can increment (without using the system bus or ALU), and the ALU can compute
aluOperand + bus, aluOperand - bus,  ~(state.aluOperand & bus).  Note that ALU
is not a register--it performs some function on the operands (i.e. you can't
say ALU=something, but you can say aluResult = aluOperand + bus.  instrReg can
also drive a sign-extended version of bits 15-0 onto the bus (i.e. bits 15-0
are from instrReg, bits 31-16 are the same as bit 15).  Use
convertNum(state.instrReg & 0xFFFF) for this sign-extension.


5. Finite-State Machine Description (70%)

A finite-state machine describes in detail the order of events necessary to
carry out the computer's instructions. As described in Chapter 5 of the course
textbook, a "big-picture" look at the sequence of a generic instruction would
be 1) fetch the instruction from the memory, 2) decode the instruction and
decide what to do, 3) execute the instruction, then repeat. Your job is to
break down each of these steps to form a detailed finite-state machine that
shows all data transfers of each instruction.

You will use C to describe the finite-state machine.  Start with the code
included below and add the part of the simulator that executes instructions
(the "run" function in the Project 1 solution).

Because C is much more powerful than an ordinary finite-state machine, we will
place strict limits on how you will describe your finite-state machine in C.
This will only apply for the part of the program that executes instructions
(e.g. not for the code that loads the program). The code that executes
instructions must obey the following rules:

1) Only use if...else-if...else goto for conditional execution (you may not use
for, while, do, case, ?:). For example:

    if ((instrReg>>22) == ADD) {
        goto add;
    }

The only code inside the body of if and else statement should be a goto (and
possibly debugging printfs).  Hint: the finite-state machine should only have
three types of if statements.  One is for the instruction decode (the next
state depends on the instruction); the second is to test if memory is ready
(see Section 6); the third is for the branch instruction.

The goto represents the next-state function, hence there should be no
code in a state after a goto section.

2) Every distinct state in the finite-state machine should have a label before
the C statements in that state (and there should be no extra labels).  Since
you can execute several different operations in a single cycle (i.e. a single
state in the finite-state machine), not every line of C code will have a
label.  For instance, to load the memoryAddress register from the
programCounter (as part of the instruction fetch), your code would be:

fetch:
	printState(&state, "fetch");
	bus = programCounter;
	memoryAddress = bus;

3) You may only transfer data where there is a connection shown on the
register diagram.  That's why the example above transfers the programCounter
data to the memoryAddress register via the system bus.  There is no connection
between memoryAddress and programCounter, so you may not say memoryAddress =
programCounter directly.  This will help you to see what can and can't be done
in a single cycle (e.g. you can't drive the system bus with two different
values, but you can load multiple registers from the system bus).

4) You can't use the new value of a register until the cycle after you
write it. For example, if cycle 1 is "A=B", then you can't use the new
value of A until cycle 2. This is because A doesn't actually get
written until the end of cycle 1/beginning of cycle 2.  In particular,
remember that the control unit reads instrReg and aluResult, which are
registers.  An "exception" to this rule is the return value of
memoryAccess (see Section 6). In one cycle, you may call memoryAccess
and then test the return value of memoryAccess to decide which state
to go to next.  The reason for this "exception" is that the return
value of memoryAccess is a signal, not the output of a register.

5) The only functions you may use are printf, memoryAccess, convertNum,
and printState.

6) The only variables you may use are 1) the variables specified in the
state structure, 2) a variable to hold the return value of memoryAccess, and
3) the value of the system bus.

7) You may use the normal arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %) as well as the
bit operations in C (& |, << >> ~).

8) You may use printfs wherever you want.

9) You must assume that at the end of any given instruction every register
other than the programCounter and the register file could be reset.  This
could happen if an interrupt were to occur.  In that case only the
architecturally visible things (program counter and register file) would be
reset to their proper values.  In other words, you may NOT start
executing an instruction before the previous instruction finished.  This
includes taking advantage of the next instruction's address being available
on the bus at the end of the previous instruction.  You may not work on two
different instructions in the same clock.

10) Given the above limitations, you must execute your program executing as
few states as possible.  In other words, you must call printState() as few
times as possible.

6. Memory

For Project 1, you implemented memory as a simple array and accessed it
directly (e.g. by saying something like data=state.mem[address].  For this
project, you will still implement memory as an array, but the method of
accessing memory will be more strictly controlled.

You must use the memoryAccess function (included below) to read or write
memory.  memoryAccess will often need to be called several times (over several
cycles) before it successfully reads or writes memory; this models the delay
involved in accessing memory.  Your finite-state machine will have to look at
the return value to see if the memory was successfully accessed and either
retry the memory access or proceed with the next state. If the return value is
1, then memoryData was successfully loaded (for reading memory) or copied into
memory (for writing memory). If the return value is 0, then your finite-state
machine should re-try the memory access.

Note that the only way to access memory is via memoryAddress and memoryData.
For example, to write a memory location, you must load the memoryData register
with the data to be written, load the memoryAddress register with the address
to write to, then do the memory access by calling memoryAccess.

7. Tips

You may find that it is easy to somehow optimize between instructions.  This
was done in previous semesters.  Don't do it.  (see rule 9, above)  

As a good rule of thumb, every instruction, other than halt, should end in
going back to the fetch state for the next instruction.

8. Running and Demonstrating Your Program

The function printState (included below) prints the state label and the current
contents of all memory, registers, and internal registers.  Your program should
call printState BEFORE executing each state (i.e. right after each label).  See
the example in item #2 of Section 5.  Your program should also call printState
just before exiting.  Your final state will look like this:

halt:
	printState(&state, "halt");
	exit(0);

Your simulator should be run using the same command format specified in Project
1, that is:

	simulate program.mc > output

You should use the solution assembler from Project 1 to create the machine-code
file that your simulator will run (since that's how we'll test it).  Simulators
that do not accept the right machine code format will receive a 0.

9. Grading, Auto-Grading, and Formatting

We will grade primarily on correctly computing combination, functionality and
efficiency for the finite-state machine, and following the programming
limitations for describing the finite-state machine.  If you have any doubts
about what is an acceptable finite-state machine, ask an instructor during
office hours.  I expect the newsgroup to have a discussion on this also,
though the details have to be omitted (since you shouldn't post your actual
code).

To help you validate your program, your submission will be automatically run
against several test cases, and the result will be mailed back to you.  You
then have the option of correcting some problems and re-submitting.  The
results will not be very illuminating; they won't tell you where your problem
is or give you the test programs.  The main benefit of doing this is so you
know to keep working on debugging your program (rather than thinking it's
perfect and ending up with a 0).  The best way to debug your program is to
generate your own test cases, figure out the correct answers, and compare your
program's output to the correct answers.  This is also one of the best ways to
learn the concepts in the project.

You may submit your program as many times as you like.  

Because all programs will be auto-graded, you must be careful to
follow the exact formatting rules in the project description:

    1) (combination) Store the result in register 3.

    2) (combination) The two input numbers must be in locations labeled
	"n" and "r" (lower-case).  Your submitted combination program can
	use any values for n and r.

    3) (simulator) Don't modify printState or stateStruct at all.  Download
	this handout into your program electronically (don't re-type it) so you
	avoid typos.

    4) (simulator) Call printState once before each state executes and once
	just before the simulator exits.  Do not call printState at any other
	time.

    5) (simulator) Don't print the sequence "@@@" anywhere except in printState.

    6) (simulator) state.numMemory must be equal to the number of lines in the
	machine-code file.
    
    7) (simulator) Initialize the PC and the 8 LC-2K7 registers to 0.
        Do not initialize the internal registers (memoryAddress,
        memoryData, instrReg, aluOperand, and aluResult).

10. Turning in the Project

Use the submit370 program to submit your files.  Here are the files you should
submit for each project part:

    1) combination (part 2c)
	a. assembly-language program for computing combination(n,r)

	example:
	    submit370 2c comb.as

    2) simulator (part 2s)
        a. C program for your simulator (name should end in ".c")

	example:
	    submit370 2s simulate.c

Your simulator must be in a single C file.  We will compile your program on a
Linux workstation using "gcc program.c -lm", so your program should not require
additional compiler flags or libraries.

We will count the highest score that you receive as the fineal grade for the 
project (i.e. not necessarily the score for the last submission). However, 
if you submit after the deadline - you will use your late day(s) and after that
your submissions will not be considered for grading.

11. Code Fragment for Simulator

Here is some C code that may help you write the simulator.  Again, you should
take this merely as a hint.  You may have to re-code this to make it do
exactly what you want, but this should help you get started.  Remember not
to change stateStruct, printState, or memoryAccess.  For your convenience,
this code is also available online from the web here 
without html formatting, so you can directly use it.
