                    Project 4--EECS 370 (Winter 2008)
                             Worth: 10 points
                    Assigned: Tuesday, March 18, 2008

1. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to teach you about cache design and how a
caching processor generates and services address references.

2. Problem

In this project, you will simulate a CPU cache (unified instruction/data) and
integrate the cache into a Project 1 (behavioral) simulator.  As the processor
simulator executes an assembly-language program, it will access instructions
and data.  These accesses will be serviced by the cache, which will transfer
data to/from memory as needed.

3. Cache Simulator

The central part of this project is to write a function that implements a
flexible cache simulator.  The cache function will be used by the processor
simulation when the processor accesses addresses.  Your cache function should
be able to simulate a variety of cache configurations.  Once integrated into
your processor simulator, the program will be run as follows:

    simulate program.mc blockSizeInWords numberOfSets blocksPerSet

Your cache function should simulate a cache with the following characteristics:

    1) WRITE POLICY: write-back

    2) ASSOCIATIVITY: varies according to the "blocksPerSet" parameter.
        Associativity ranges from 1 (direct-mapped) to the number of blocks
        in the cache (fully associative).

    3) SIZE: the total number of words in the cache is
        blockSizeInWords * numberOfSets * blocksPerSet

    4) BLOCK SIZE: varies according to the "blockSizeInWords" parameter.  All
        transfers between the cache and memory take place in units of a single
        block.

    5) PLACEMENT/REPLACEMENT POLICY: when looking for a block within a set to
        replace, the best block to replace is an invalid (empty) block.  If
        there is none of these, replace the least-recently used block.

Make sure the units of each parameter are as specified.  Note that the smallest
data granularity in this project is a word, because this is the data
granularity of the LC-2K7 architecture.  blockSizeInWords, numberOfSets, and
blocksPerSet should all be powers of two.  To simplify your program, you may
assume that the maximum number of cache blocks is 256 (this small number allows
you to use a 2-dimensional array for the cache data structure).

4. Origin and Servicing of Address References

As the processor executes an assembly-language program, it accesses addresses.
The three sources of address references are instruction fetch, lw, and sw.
When the program starts up, it will initialize the memory with the machine-code
file as in Project 1.  These initialization references should NOT be passed to
the cache simulator; they should simply set the initial memory state.

Each address reference should be passed to the cache simulator.  The cache
simulator keeps track of what blocks are currently in the cache and what state
they are in (e.g. dirty, valid, etc.).  To service the address reference, the
cache simulator may need to write back a dirty cache block to memory, then it
may need to read a block into the cache from memory.  After these possible
steps, the cache simulator should return the data to the processor (for
read accesses) or write the data to the cache (for write accesses).  Each
of these data transfers will be logged by calling the printAction function
(don't modify this code at all):

enum actionType
        {cacheToProcessor, processorToCache, memoryToCache, cacheToMemory,
        cacheToNowhere};
/*
 * Log the specifics of each cache action.
 *
 * address is the starting word address of the range of data being transferred.
 * size is the size of the range of data being transferred.
 * type specifies the source and destination of the data being transferred.
 *     cacheToProcessor: reading data from the cache to the processor
 *     processorToCache: writing data from the processor to the cache
 *     memoryToCache: reading data from the memory to the cache
 *     cacheToMemory: evicting cache data by writing it to the memory
 *     cacheToNowhere: evicting cache data by throwing it away
 */
void
printAction(int address, int size, enum actionType type)
{
    printf("@@@ transferring word [%d-%d] ", address, address + size - 1);
    if (type == cacheToProcessor) {
        printf("from the cache to the processor\n");
    } else if (type == processorToCache) {
        printf("from the processor to the cache\n");
    } else if (type == memoryToCache) {
        printf("from the memory to the cache\n");
    } else if (type == cacheToMemory) {
        printf("from the cache to the memory\n");
    } else if (type == cacheToNowhere) {
        printf("from the cache to nowhere\n");
    }
}

5. Test Cases

An integral (and graded) part of writing your cache simulator will be to
write a suite of test cases to validate any LC-2K7 cache simulator.  This
is common practice in the real world--software companies maintain a suite of
test cases for their programs and use this suite to check the program's
correctness after a change.  Writing a comprehensive suite of test cases will
deepen your understanding of the project specification and your program, and
it will help you a lot as you debug your program.

The test cases for this project will be short assembly-language programs that,
after being assembled into machine code, serve as input to a simulator.  You
will submit your suite of test cases together with your simulator, and we will
grade your test suite according to how thoroughly it exercises an LC-2K7 cache
simulator.  Each test case may generate at most 200 printAction statements
on a correct simulator, and your test suite may contain up to 20 test cases.
These limits are much larger than needed for full credit.

Each test case will specify the cache parameters to use when running the test
case.  These parameters will be communicated via the name of the test case
file.  Each test case should have a 3-part suffix, where each part identifies a
cache parameter and the parts are separated by periods:

    anyName.<blockSizeInWords>.<numberOfSets>.<blocksPerSet>

For example, the test case in Section 8 would be named "test.as.4.2.1".  The
combination of cache parameters should be legal (e.g. they should all be powers
of two; numberOfSets and blocksPerSet should not exceed 256).  The instructor
buggy simulators will not have error-checking bugs.  See Section 6 for how your
test suite will be graded.

Writing good test cases for this project will require careful planning.  Think
about what different types of behavior a cache can exhibit and generate test
cases that cause the cache to exhibit each behavior.  Think about how to test
the various algorithms used in the cache simulator, e.g. LRU, writebacks, read
and write hits, read and write misses.  As you write the code for your
simulator, keep notes on different conditions you think of, and write test
cases to test those conditions.

6. Grading, Auto-Grading, and Formatting

We will grade on the correctness of your cache simulator and the
comprehensiveness of your test suite.

To help you validate your project, your submission will be graded
automatically, and the result will be mailed back to you.  You may then
continue to work on the project and re-submit.  You do not have a limit for dayly 
submissions. The results from the auto-grader will not be very illuminating; 
they won't tell you where your problem is or give you the test programs.  
The purpose of the auto-grader is it helps you know to keep working on your 
project (rather than thinking it's perfect and ending up with a 0).  The best 
way to debug your program is to generate your own test cases, figure out the 
correct answers, and compare your program's output to the correct answers.  
This is also one of the best ways to learn the concepts in the project.

The student suite of test cases for the simulator will be graded according to
how thoroughly they test a cache simulator.  We will judge thoroughness of the
test suite by how well it exposes potentially bugs in a cache simulator.  The
auto-grader will correctly assemble each test case in your suite, then use it
as input to a set of buggy simulators.  A test case exposes a buggy simulator
by causing it to generate a different answer from a correct simulator.  The
test suite is graded based on how many of the buggy simulators were exposed by
at least one test case.

Because all programs will be auto-graded, you must be careful to follow
the exact formatting rules in the project description:

    1) Don't modify printAction at all.  Download this handout into your
        program electronically (don't re-type it) so you avoid typos.

    2) Check your program's output on the sample assembly-language program and
        output at the end of this handout.

    3) Don't print the sequence "@@@" anywhere except in printAction().  You
        may find the Project 1 printState function useful in debugging, but
        make sure to take out printState's @@@.

7. Turning in the Project

Use the submit370 program to submit your files.  Here are the files you should
submit:

    1) cache simulator (part 4)
        a. C program for your simulator (name should end in ".c")
        b. suite of test cases (each test case is an assembly-language program
            in a separate file).  Each test case should have a suffix
            which tells the auto-grader which cache parameters should be
            used when running that test case (see Section 5).

        example:
            submit370 4 simulate.c test1.as.4.2.1 test2.as.1.1.4 test3.as.2.8.2

Your simulator must be in a single C file.  We will compile your program on a
Linux workstation using "gcc program.c -lm", so your program should not require
additional compiler flags or libraries.

The official time of submission for your project will be the time the last file
is sent. If you send in anything after the due date, your project will be
considered late (and will use up your late days or will receive a zero).

8. Sample Assembly-Language Program and Output

Here is a sample assembly-language program:
        sw      0       1       6
        lw      0       1       23
        lw      0       1       30
        halt

and its corresponding output with the following cache parameters:
blockSizeInWords = 4, numberOfSets = 2, and blocksPerSet = 1.  Make sure you
understand each of the data transfers and their order.

@@@ transferring word [0-3] from the memory to the cache
@@@ transferring word [0-0] from the cache to the processor
@@@ transferring word [4-7] from the memory to the cache
@@@ transferring word [6-6] from the processor to the cache
@@@ transferring word [1-1] from the cache to the processor
@@@ transferring word [4-7] from the cache to the memory
@@@ transferring word [20-23] from the memory to the cache
@@@ transferring word [23-23] from the cache to the processor
@@@ transferring word [2-2] from the cache to the processor
@@@ transferring word [20-23] from the cache to nowhere
@@@ transferring word [28-31] from the memory to the cache
@@@ transferring word [30-30] from the cache to the processor
@@@ transferring word [3-3] from the cache to the processor
